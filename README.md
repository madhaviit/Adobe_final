# Adobe Behaviour Simulation Challenge

## Overview

This repository contains the final submission for the Adobe Challenge. The challenge involves behavior simulation and content generation, divided into two tasks. This README file provides an overview of the project, instructions for setup, and details about the implementation.

## Task 1: Behavior Simulation

This task focuses on behavior simulation, where the goal is to give the user, an estimated number of likes that a particular tweet will recieve on twitter if the tweet is posted on the platfrom from the community.
Therefore, the outline of this task was to make a machine learning model that will simulate the people present on twitter and give a numerical value that will correspond to the number of likes it may recieve on the platform.

## Task 2: Content Generation

This task involves content generation, aiming to generate the content of the tweet, given the metadata of the tweet, i.e. given the number of likes, content attached, time, usernames etc. predict what would be the tweet. This is beneficial if a user is not able to think about the tweet content, then it can just give the model the data and the target likes it wants, and the mdel will generate the content of the tweet.
